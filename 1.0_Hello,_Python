# Operator	Name	Description
a + b	Addition	Sum of a and b
a - b	Subtraction	Difference of a and b
a * b	Multiplication	Product of a and b
a / b	True division	Quotient of a and b
a // b	Floor division	Quotient of a and b, removing fractional parts
a % b	Modulus	Integer remainder after division of a by b
a ** b	Exponentiation	a raised to the power of b
-a	Negation	The negative of a

# Operator / True division

# Operator //
The // operator gives us a result that's rounded down to the next integer.
print(5 // 2)

# How tall am I, in meters, when wearing my hat?
total_height_meters = hat_height_cm + my_height_cm / 100
print("Height in meters =", total_height_meters, "?")

Solution:
total_height_meters = (hat_height_cm + my_height_cm) / 100
print("Height in meters =", total_height_meters)
