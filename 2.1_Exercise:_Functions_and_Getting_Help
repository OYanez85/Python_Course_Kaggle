mistake: ruond_to_two_places(9.9999)
solution: round_to_two_places(9.9999)
-------------
mistake: 
x = -10
y = 5
# # Which of the two variables above has the smallest absolute value?
smallest_abs = min(abs(x, y))

solution:
x = -10
y = 5
# Compare the absolute values of x and y to find the smallest
smallest_abs = min(abs(x), abs(y))
print(smallest_abs)

mistake:
def f(x):

 return y

solution:
